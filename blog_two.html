            <p>Student while starting these development journey in college often gets confused whether to join Web Development or Mobile Development. <br><br>Both web and mobile development have there own significance in the industry. First let's talk about Web Development &#8658; <br><br>Web Development often treated as a easy journey in learning when people start coding as a passion as student learn HTML and CSS as there basic step. <br>But student should also get to know that it is a long journey more precise it is  a very long journey. Being a full stack web developer is not easy or we can say it's a long learning journey. while gradually adavancing in this journey student have to choose any of two path: MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, Node.js) or MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, Node.js). <br><br>When compared to mobile development in terms of difficulty, mobile has upper hand over web development. <br>Now let's talk about mobile development &#8658; <br><br>Mobile Development is a new technology when compared to web development. Mobile development is approximate 10 years old while web development is from the time when internet came into existence. <br>In mobile development a student can choose whether he wants to go with android or iOS development. for android development the prerequisite is to learn Java or Kotlin while for iOS development student has to learn  Swift. <br><br> Learning mobile development is difficult when compared to web development but learning web development is also not easy. <br>We also have to note that mobile development is hot topic in current IT industry but web development is not going anywhere atleast till the time we have internet. <br><br>So it's all about the interest and the technology which attracts student to these two. By the way, which technology you like most...? <br><br>If you like my post do support me on social media handle below.  </p>
