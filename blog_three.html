            <h1><a class="link-active" href="/">Life as a Tier 3 college student in India.</a></h1>
            <p>This story is going to sound similiar to most of student who study in a tier 3 college as every student is not as brilliant as to get a tier 1 college and if he is tier 1 college don't have that much of seats in college. <br><br>Some students work hard in there eleventh and twelfth standard to get a good tier 1 college while others accept the fact that tier 3 college is there destiny.<br>Though this journey is about me and how i spent these four years of my life. <br><br>Many students think that college life is fun and you get full freedom to do anything you want but bursting your bubble it's not that easy. Atleast tier 3 student life is not that easy for one who wants to do something good in his/her life. It's just that during the initial phase of his life (i.e. 12th standard) he can't figure it out and that's totally fine. <br><br>My journey was also same as I don't have any idea of what to do after 12th standard. <br><br>But as this remain similar for most of tier 3 student that in college we waste most of our time in fun. Same goes with me and when I realised I started to work on myself by learning new technology and being best what I can do. Though my journey is near to end in my college and Let's figure out what most I can make out of it. <br><br>One last and final advise to every junior who is entering into the college life is "Start Early, Start Now". As time is running fast. <br><br>If you like my post do support me on soial media handle below.</p>
